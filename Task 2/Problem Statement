Problem Statement

Implement a GMM based clustering framework on the image ‘building.jpg’. You may
choose 3 Gaussian components and use the RGB values as the features. Start the iterations
using the means μ1 = [ 120 120 120 ]' μ2 = [ 12 12 12 ]' and μ3 = [ 180 180 180 ]'.

Also assume an identity
covariance matrix for each of the components.
1. Dispay the segmented output.
2. Display a graph depicting the convergence of the log likelihood values.
