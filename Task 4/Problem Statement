Problem Statement

Task 4 : Support Vector Machines

Build a SVM Classifier for the classes !1 , !2 and !3 using a Radial Basis Function Kernel. Plot a graph depicting the 
recognition accuracy on the test data Test1.mat, Test2.mat and Test3.mat for different values of penalty factors C and precisions
of the Radial Basis Function. The software package that I recommend for this task is LibSVM. On their webpage, download the version 
(either Matlab/Python),appropriate to the platform in which you are working.
