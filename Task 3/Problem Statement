Task 3: Face Recognition using PCA

The gallery folder `Gallery.zip' contains images from 40 individuals, each of them providing 5 images. The pixel intensities
of the 200 face images will be used for computing the KL Transform. By employing the method of efficient computation of the 
basis vectors for high dimensional data (discussed in class),

(i) Display the Eigenface images corresponding to the top 5 Eigen values of the covariance matrix Σ.

(ii) Plot a graph depicting the percentage of the total variance of the original data retained in the reduced space versus the 
number of dimensions. From this graph, find the number of dimensions required for projecting the face vectors so that at least
95% of the total variance of the original data is accounted for in the reduced space.

(iii) Reconstruct the image ‘face input 1.pgm’ using the:

(a) Eigenface corresponding to the largest eigenvalue.
(b) Top 15 Eigenfaces
(c) All the Eigenfaces

Display the reconstructed image and the mean squared error in each case.

(iv) Depict graphically the mean squared error obtained for different number of Eigenfaces. Note that the Eigenfaces will vary
from 1 to 200 (total number of training samples).

(v) Repeat the parts (iii) and (iv) for the image ‘face input 2.pgm’. Comment on your result.
